A set of tools I'm experimenting with to help myself learn to write better zero-shot prompts. ðŸ˜³

## What's this good for
I find this tool most useful after the early rapid iteration stage when I'm ready to test a few different prompt strategies. Once Iâ€™ve selected the final set of candidates, I can also use it to compare their performance across different scenarios.

## How to use
1. Tweak the prompts and the variables directly in prompts/prompts.json
2. Run the dev server
3. Enter OpenAI Key on top
4. Enter variables for each set of scenarios
5. Click Run to test the different prompts variations across different scnearios!

## Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the result.
